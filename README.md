The following **optional** features are implemented:

## Notes

I worked with UserDefaults for the first time, and at first creating the Settings screen sounded challenging. However, I am glad I took that challenge: it ended up taking only a few lines of code, but I learned a lot on the way.

The UI is inspired by this [work on Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/3300627-Simple-Tip-Calculator)
